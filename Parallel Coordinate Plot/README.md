>In this homework, goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset by using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.
